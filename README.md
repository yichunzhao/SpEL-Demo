# SpEL-Demo

The Spring Expression Language (“SpEL” for short) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. It is a single well supported within the Spring community, but it is self-contained and can be used independently. SpEL supports calling methods, accessing properties, and calling constructors.
